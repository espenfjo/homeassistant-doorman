# homeassistant-doorman
Custom component for the Yale Doorman lock(s) via the Yale Smart HUB.

Supports:
 * Reading current state
 * Reading past state via the report API (Same as the history in the app)

Unsupported:
 * Unlocking or locking the door (Although trivial to implement)

Tested with the V2N lock.

## Installation

Place the `custom_components` folder in your Home Assistant configuration folder.
